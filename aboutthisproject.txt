PROJECT: Custom Membership Platform Builder
CORE PURPOSE:
We're creating a demo/template for a white-label membership platform that content creators can use as an alternative to platforms like Patreon/OnlyFans. The key difference is that creators get their own independent website rather than being part of a larger platform.
KEY FEATURES:

Membership System:


Three tiers: Basic, Premium
, All access
Monthly/Annual billing options
Each tier unlocks different content levels
Members get badges showing their tier level


Content Feed:


Similar to social media feed but with paywalled content
Multiple content types:

Videos with custom player
Image galleries
Audio content
Downloadable files
Community polls
Regular posts/updates


Content is marked with which tier can access it
Non-subscribers see locked content with subscription prompts


Store Integration:


Sell physical/digital products separately from memberships
Member discounts based on tier
Shopping cart system
Multiple product types (merch, digital goods, etc.)


User Experience:


Clean, professional interface
Tab system: Home (Feed), About, Membership, Store
Easy navigation between sections
Clear indicators of locked/unlocked content

BUSINESS MODEL:
This is a B2B service where we:

Sell to content creators on platforms like Fiverr/Upwork
Offer tiered pricing ($799 - $2,999+)
Customize each installation for the client
Let creators keep more revenue vs traditional platforms

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Built with Next.js and TypeScript
Uses Tailwind for styling
Component-based architecture
Mock authentication for demo purposes
Responsive design for all devices

DEMO PURPOSE:
The site we're building is a fully functional demo that:

Shows potential buyers how their site would work
Lets users test all features without real payments
Demonstrates the user experience for both creators and their members

Think of it as "Patreon in a box" - creators get all the features of a membership platform but in their own independent website that they fully control.
PROJECT STATUS:
We're building out core functionality including:

Feed system with multiple content types
Membership tier management
Store integration
User authentication flow
Content access control

The core philosophy is giving creators independence from large platforms while maintaining a professional, easy-to-use experience for their members.
